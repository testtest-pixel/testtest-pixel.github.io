It’s in the constant pressure, the constant fear, It's the deadlines looming, relentless, near, A cacophony of shoulds and musts. Wouldn’t it be easier if I could just Ignore the weight that presses heavy on my shoulders, Promise myself i’ll deal with things eventually when i’m older If i could just walk away and accept the fact that I’ve failed and tell myself that it’s okay Even when it’s not It’d be so much easier to let things just float away Just barely participate in each day Not invested in that, not worried about this Who cares if that shot was a miss? Not really happy, but not really sad Just somewhere in the middle, does that sound so bad? And yet every time I want to quit There’s this nagging feeling, this annoying itch I’d rather laugh than smile Even if means shedding tears instead of frowning Because for every problem that i’ve gotten wrong I’m sure that there’s at least two that’ve been right all along And it’s more fun to be invested, it’s more fun to care It’s the small moments of victory after a night of pulling out your hair That makes the stress worth it That makes the discomfort okay That make me want to get up and try again, day after day after day And whether it’s a test, a relationship, or a paper I could fail Well, yes, it hurts, it’ll hurt every time But having the opportunity to fail at these things To care enough that I do Makes everything worth it, every single thing I go through </pre> </div> <!-- Metrical Poem --> <div class="mb-10"> <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-1">Metrical Poem</h3> <p class="italic text-gray-600 mb-3">Iambic Pentameter</p> <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap font-serif text-gray-800 leading-relaxed bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow"> The glass reveals the wrinkles near her eyes Reveals all the sagging skin on her cheeks The glass reveals the graying of her hair Reveals the deep creases next to her lips If she could make all the lines disappear, Would all her memories fade away too? If she could choose between her creaking joints, Or the journal from when she was a child, If she could choose between her aching hip, Or the decade-old pictures on the wall, Would she choose to make herself young again, Or was the long life she lived worth it all? </pre> </div> <!-- Free Verse Poems --> <div class="space-y-10"> <div> <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Free Verse</h3> <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap font-serif text-gray-800 leading-relaxed bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow"> Why do you stay? When escape is so much easier, when the keys are within your but you stay behind the bars. Why do you try? When you know it will end in tears, when you know it will drag you down further When you get pushed down a lifetime for every footstep - yet you look to the sky and continue to climb. Do the brambles not prick your skin? You speak of the roses within, even as the thorns cut you apart And yet you smile even as you drown beneath unrelenting waves even as the wind tears you down you see hope long after your eyes disappear Why? </pre> </div> <div> <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Free Verse II</h3> <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap font-serif text-gray-800 leading-relaxed bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow"> It seems like life is in a constant decline Every time I fall, I swear it’ll be the last time But the ground keeps cracking beneath my weight And by the time I reach for a hold it’s already too late Still, I can’t seem to accept this eternal fall Can’t accept that this might be all I keep scrambling for a ledge, a bridge, a hold A helping hand, if one were ever so bold Perhaps they would help, if they knew That from where I am, the sky no longer seems blue Laughter seems like a distant thought Happiness seems trivial, something that can be bought But I fake a smile as I fall, smile every day Maybe if I fake it enough, i’ll learn to finally feel this way </pre> </div> <div> <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Free Verse III</h3> <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap font-serif text-gray-800 leading-relaxed bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow"> Okay, I’ve gotten here What now? I’ve reached the final goal My ship has run aground I didn’t realize i’d be this easy Didn’t realize seas would be so calm I’ve dedicated my life to this travel, Its mark forever etched in my palm But all the journeys I’ve made Are so easily pushed away All the words i’ve written Are read to be forgotten Do my accomplishments really not matter to someone who isn’t me? Do they all just watch as a man Pushes his boat into the sea? Pretending to watch until I reach the horizon And when I am back They forget i’ve ever lived among them </pre> </div> <div> <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Free Verse IV</h3> <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap font-serif text-gray-800 leading-relaxed bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow"> A garden full of stones One for every dream ever owned For all the dreams lost with time and age For dreams lost in a moment of rage For dreams with a stick in the sand For dreams guaranteed with the shake of a hand Everyone loses a dream, whether big or small For those who truly wish to remember The little garden holds them all </pre> </div> <div> <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Free Verse V</h3> <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap font-serif text-gray-800 leading-relaxed bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow"> The creases on her weathered face Hills and valleys in a barren land The old woman walks into the waves Her cane clutched in her steady hand In her eyes, clouded and dim I wonder what wisdom lies within What has she seen, This woman with hair like ash and a toothless grin What does she know, This woman who hobbles and creaks What could she say, This woman, if she ever speaks She doesn’t turn back as she gets further from the shore The sun begins to set, the air grows cold I watch as the water rises above her head The waves pulling her under, the woman sinking like lead She does not appear again, though I wait days and nights I know the woman is against the sand, her body limp, cane in her hand And still I wait for something to show Her life, rich and heavy, could not have been so easy to go </pre> </div> </div> </section>
