    <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap font-serif text-gray-800 leading-relaxed bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
It's in the shallow breaths I take,
In the restless nights, the dreams that keep me awake,
In the hurried steps, my racing heart,
It’s barely a whisper, but it’s tearing me apart.
It’s in the constant pressure, the constant fear,
It's the deadlines looming, relentless, near,
A cacophony of shoulds and musts.
Wouldn’t it be easier if I could just
Ignore the weight that presses heavy on my shoulders,
Promise myself i’ll deal with things eventually when i’m older
If i could just walk away and accept the fact that
I’ve failed and tell myself that it’s okay
Even when it’s not
It’d be so much easier to let things just float away
Just barely participate in each day
Not invested in that, not worried about this
Who cares if that shot was a miss?
Not really happy, but not really sad
Just somewhere in the middle, does that sound so bad?

And yet every time I want to quit
There’s this nagging feeling, this annoying itch
I’d rather laugh than smile
Even if means shedding tears instead of frowning
Because for every problem that i’ve gotten wrong
I’m sure that there’s at least two that’ve been right all along
And it’s more fun to be invested, it’s more fun to care
It’s the small moments of victory after a night of pulling out your hair
That makes the stress worth it
That makes the discomfort okay
That make me want to get up and try again, day after day after day

And whether it’s a test, a relationship, or a paper I could fail
Well, yes, it hurts, it’ll hurt every time
But having the opportunity to fail at these things
To care enough that I do
Makes everything worth it, every single thing I go through

The glass reveals the wrinkles near her eyes
Reveals all the sagging skin on her cheeks
The glass reveals the graying of her hair
Reveals the deep creases next to her lips
If she could make all the lines disappear,
Would all her memories fade away too?
If she could choose between her creaking joints,
Or the journal from when she was a child,
If she could choose between her aching hip,
Or the decade-old pictures on the wall,
Would she choose to make herself young again,
Or was the long life she lived worth it all?

      <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap font-serif text-gray-800 leading-relaxed bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
Why do you stay?
When escape is so much easier,
when the keys are within your
but you stay behind the bars.
Why do you try?
When you know it will end in tears,
when you know it will drag you down
further
When you get pushed down a lifetime
for every footstep - yet you look to the
sky and continue to climb.
Do the brambles not prick your skin?
You speak of the roses within, even as
the thorns cut you apart
And yet you smile
even as you drown beneath
unrelenting waves
even as the wind tears you down
you see hope
long after your eyes disappear
Why?

      <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap font-serif text-gray-800 leading-relaxed bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
It seems like life is in a
constant decline
Every time I fall, I swear it’ll be
the last time
But the ground keeps cracking beneath my weight
And by the time I reach for a hold it’s already too late
Still, I can’t seem to accept this eternal fall
Can’t accept that this might be all
I keep scrambling for a ledge, a bridge, a hold
A helping hand, if one were ever so bold
Perhaps they would help, if they knew
That from where I am, the sky no longer seems blue
Laughter seems like a distant thought
Happiness seems trivial, something that can be bought
But I fake a smile as I fall, smile every day
Maybe if I fake it enough, i’ll learn to finally feel this way

      <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap font-serif text-gray-800 leading-relaxed bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
Okay, I’ve gotten here
What now?
I’ve reached the final goal
My ship has run aground
I didn’t realize i’d be this easy
Didn’t realize seas would be so calm
I’ve dedicated my life to this travel,
Its mark forever etched in my palm
But all the journeys I’ve made
Are so easily pushed away
All the words i’ve written
Are read to be forgotten
Do my accomplishments really not matter
to someone who isn’t me?
Do they all just watch as a man
Pushes his boat into the sea?
Pretending to watch until I reach the horizon
And when I am back
They forget i’ve ever lived among them
      </pre>

      <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap font-serif text-gray-800 leading-relaxed bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
A garden full of stones
One for every dream ever owned
For all the dreams lost with time and age
For dreams lost in a moment of rage
For dreams with a stick in the sand
For dreams guaranteed with the shake of a hand
Everyone loses a dream, whether big or small
For those who truly wish to remember
The little garden holds them all

      <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">Free Verse V</h3>
      <pre class="whitespace-pre-wrap font-serif text-gray-800 leading-relaxed bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow">
The creases on her weathered face
Hills and valleys in a barren land
The old woman walks into the waves
Her cane clutched in her steady hand
In her eyes, clouded and dim
I wonder what wisdom lies within
What has she seen,
This woman with hair like ash and a toothless grin
What does she know,
This woman who hobbles and creaks
What could she say,
This woman, if she ever speaks
She doesn’t turn back as she gets further from the shore
The sun begins to set, the air grows cold
I watch as the water rises above her head
The waves pulling her under, the woman sinking like lead
She does not appear again, though I wait days and nights
I know the woman is against the sand, her body limp, cane in her hand
And still I wait for something to show
Her life, rich and heavy, could not have been so easy to go
